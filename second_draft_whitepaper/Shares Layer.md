# Share Layer
By joining 1 ETH with 1 Security Bond and attaching it to a market one can create a complete set which can then be split into YES, NO and Invalid share tokens. When the market ends or the complete set get redeemed for ETH, the Security Bond get released and can be used in a new share token again.

These complete sets can also be wrapped to add fees to them to create tokens with fees

## Market Finalization
Once a market finalizes the shares can be redeemed with Security Pool Layer to be converter back to ETH.

## Forking
Share tokens and wrapped share token also need to support forking, and split the shares
